### Exploring Git

#
<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center">Introduction</p>

#

Git is a version control and source code management system. Users can use Git to save their application code and distribute their code to other users. Git was initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development. Git is free, open source distributed software.

This section explains how to use Git while developing applications.

Let’s discuss some of the advantages of Git before we get it up and running.

**Advantages of Git**

- **Free and open source**
- **Fast and small** – Git speeds up the development process because most of its operations are performed locally. 
- **Implicit backup** - Since the repository is mirrored on the client side, it can be used as a backup in the event of a crash or disk corruption.
- **Security** - Provides good security to avoid any malpractices.

**Git terminology**

1. **Local repository:**  Users can replicate an entire Git repository on their local system; this is called the user's "private workspace". Users can make changes inside their private workspace and then sync the changes with the remote repository. The process of creating a local workspace from a remote repository is called "checking out". After making changes, users can commit and push their changes to the remote repository.

2. **Branches**: Branches are parallel lines of development that are used to work on new features. By default, Git has a "master branch", which is the same as the "trunk" in Subversion.  

3. **Working directory and staging area (index)**: In Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS), developers modify files and commit their changes directly to the repository. But Git has an intermediate area where commits can be formatted and reviewed before completing the commit. This is called the "staging area" (or "index"). 

Let's take a look at the basic workflow of Git:

![Git working directory workflow](_images/git_gitWorkingDirectory.png "Git working directory workflow")                                               

Step 1: A user can modify files from the working directory (the working directory is the directory from which files are checked out).

Step 2: A user can make changes to files and add these files to the staging area. 

Step 3: When a user performs a commit operation, Git looks for files present in the staging area. Only committed files are available in the staging area. These committed files are permanently stored in the Git repository upon execution of the push operation.

4. **Pull**: The pull operation copies the latest changes from a remote repository instance to a local one.

5. **Commits**: Commits create a changeset from the user’s changes to ready them to be pushed to a remote repository.

6. **Push**: The push operation copies changes from a local repository instance to a remote one.

7. **HEAD**: HEAD is a pointer that always points to the latest commit in the branch. Whenever a user makes a commit, HEAD is updated with the latest commit. 

8. **Revision**: Revisions represent the version of the source code. Revisions in Git are represented by commits.

9. **Git URL**: The Git URL represents the location of the Git repository. This URL is stored in the config file.

10. **Tags**: Tags are very similar to branches, but the difference is that tags are immutable. Tags are linked to a specific version of the repository. Once a tag is created for a particular commit, even if a user creates a new commit, the tag will not be updated. Developers can maintain different tags for various product releases.

**Installation**

You can install Git using the *yum -y install git-core* command on the Linux server. In the VM which is provided here ,Git is already installed so you dont need to run above mentioned command as it required root access.

Output for the Git installation is as follows:

    > Loaded plugins: langpacks, product-id, search-disabled-repos, subscription-manager
    > rhel-7-server-optional-rpms                                                                                                                      | 2.0 kB

    > . . . .
    > Installed:
    >   git.x86_64 0:1.8.3.1-20.el7
    >
    > Complete!

 * To check the Git version, run the following command:

    ```execute
    git --version
    ```

* Output of the command above should be similar to the following:

    > git version 1.8.3.1


**Customize the Git environment**

You can set your Git username using the following command . In below command we have used sample user name and email id, which you can replace with your own username and email id .It is important to configure your Git username and email address, since every Git commit will use this information to identify you as the author.



* ```execute
  git config --global user.name "Steve Karl"
  ```

* You can also set your email ID:

  ```execute
  git config --global user.email "steveka23456@gmail.com"
  ```

  You can varify whether user name and email id is set correctly or not using below commands:

  ```execute
  git config --global user.name
  ```

  ```execute
  git config --global user.email
  ```

**To avoid merge commits when pulling**: When you pull the latest changes from a remote repository, if these changes are divergent, then Git creates a merge commit by default. You can avoid this via the following settings:

* ```execute
  git config --global branch.autosetuprebase always
  ```

 * Execute below command to check information you enetered , along with global option:

    ```execute
    git config --global --list
    ```

#
<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center">Lifecycle</p>

#

In this section, we will discuss the Git lifecycle. The workflow is as follows:

1. The user creates a working copy, which is a clone of the Git repository.

2. Next, the user can modify the working copy by adding or editing files.

3. If required, the user can also update the working copy by integrating other developers' changes.

4. The user reviews and then commits the changes.

5. After committing: 

   ​	a) If everything looks as expected, then the user can push the changes to the repository.

   ​	b) If the user finds that something is wrong, then he or she can correct the last commit and then push the changes to the repository.

 Below is a pictorial representation of the workflow:

![Git lifecycle diagram](_images/git_gitLifecycle.png "Git lifecycle diagram")

### Hands On with Git

#
<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center">Lab- Git Commands
</p>

#


Now let's perform the steps of the lifecycle, as discussed in the previous section, by using the following Git commands:

**The create operation**

In this section, we will learn how to add new users and create a new repository.

**Create an empty repository** 

A new repository can be initialized by using the *init* command followed by the *--bare* option.

This command creates a repository but does not create a working directory. The repository is called ".git" by default.  

1) In this example, we will use the "openshift-user" user as Git user. If you want you can use your own Git id as well but with that you will need to work with your own respository because the repository mentioned here will give error at some operations if you using own Git id.

2) Run the *pwd* command and navigate to the Git user's home directory:

    ```execute
    pwd
    ```

3) Now you can create a directory for the bare repository in the home directory:

    ```execute
    cd
    ```

    ```execute
    mkdir project.git
    ```

4) Change the directory and run the *git --bare* command:

    ```execute
    cd project.git/
    ```

    ```execute
    git --bare init
    ```

* The command above will print output similar to the following:

    > Initialized empty Git repository in /home/student/project.git/

**The clone operation**

The clone operation creates an instance of the remote repository. The clone operation not only checks out the working copy but also mirrors the complete repository.

**Usage**: *`git clone`*

Let's create a new directory and then clone the repository:

```execute
mkdir openshift_repo
```

```execute
cd openshift_repo 
```

```execute
git clone https://openshift-user:2af8c9305809c542cbb357e3231f3f2728303251@github.com/openshift-user/gs-maven.git
```

Output:

    > Cloning into 'gs-maven'...
    > remote: Enumerating objects: 7, done.
    > remote: Counting objects: 100% (7/7), done.
    > remote: Compressing objects: 100% (6/6), done.
    > remote: Total 510 (delta 0), reused 5 (delta 0), pack-reused 503
    > Receiving objects: 100% (510/510), 147.99 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
    > Resolving deltas: 100% (254/254), done.

Now let's open the project and list its contents:

```execute
cd gs-maven
```

```execute
ls -l
```

Listing the directory will print output similar to the following:

    > total 36
    > drwxrwxr-x. 4 student student 4096 Jun 25 05:54 complete
    > -rw-rw-r--. 1 student student  133 Jun 25 05:54 CONTRIBUTING.adoc
    > drwxrwxr-x. 4 student student 4096 Jun 25 05:54 initial
    > -rw-rw-r--. 1 student student  722 Jun 25 05:54 LICENSE.code.txt
    > -rw-rw-r--. 1 student student  106 Jun 25 05:54 LICENSE.writing.txt
    > -rw-rw-r--. 1 student student 9750 Jun 25 05:54 README.adoc
    > drwxrwxr-x. 2 student student 4096 Jun 25 05:54 test


**Perform changes**

Now let's add a simple text file to the repository. Please ensure you are creating a unique file in the repository. If a file with the same name is already present, please make sure you rename it first.

You can create the file in the "initial" project:

```execute
cd initial
```

```execute
echo 'This is a git test' > Steve_Karl_25062019.txt
```

Now we're ready to safely add these changes to the repository by running the following steps:

```execute
git status -s
```

The following output will result: 

    > ?? Steve_Karl_25062019.txt

Git shows question marks before the file name because this file is not a part of Git. 

Now by using the *add* command, we can add the file to the staging area:

```execute
git add Steve_Karl_25062019.txt
```

By running *git status* again, you can see a list of files that have been changed:

```execute
git status -s
```

The following output will result: 

    > A  Steve_Karl_25062019.txt

**Commit changes**

You can commit your changes by using the *git commit* command. Use the *-m* option to add inline comments:

```execute
git commit -m 'Adding a sample text file'
```

Running the command above will result in output similar to the following:

    > \[master f5ce525] Adding a sample text file
    >  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
    >  create mode 100644 initial/Steve_Karl_25062019.txt

```execute
git log
```

Press "q" to exit the Git log screen.

Running *git log* will print output similar to the following:

    > commit f5ce5254e866f579655a6e4bb03792d85ed4897c
    > Author: Steve Karl <steveka23456​@gmail​.com>
    > Date:   Tue Jun 25 06:25:44 2019 -0500
    >     Adding a sample text file
    > commit 00531bd027dbb736a882b70e900597491426f423
    > Author: root <root​@alkesh-openshift-odo-c86b387c-test​.softlayer.com>
    > Date:   Thu Jun 20 12:47:41 2019 -0500
    >     Modified the sysout
    > commit 68d95bd8246614fdbdbb2a2b4e392681169ea46b
    > Merge: 6dd6fc4 3d51974
    > Author: Greg Turnquist <gturnquist​@pivotal​.io>
    > Date:   Thu Mar 21 14:52:48 2019 -0500

**Review changes**

We can make additional changes to the file after the initial *git commit* but before we push it to the remote repository. Run the following command to check for differences in the content of the files:

```execute
git diff
```

Since we haven't made any additional changes, there is no output.

**The push operation**

The push operation stores data permanently to the remote Git repository. After a successful push operation, other developers can see the changes. You can use the *git push origin master* command to push changes. 

"Origin" is the system alias, used for pushing and fetching data to and from the primary branch (the remote origin server). 

"Master" is the master branch of the repository.

```execute
git push origin master
```

This command will prompt you for your Git username and password. If your username and password are entered and authenticated, output similar to the following will result:

    > Counting objects: 6, done.
    > Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
    > Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
    > Writing objects: 100% (4/4), 381 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.
    > Total 4 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
    > remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (2/2), completed with 2 local objects.
    > To https​://github​.com/openshift-user/gs-maven.git
    >    00531bd..f5ce525  master -> master

**The update operation**

You can execute the following command to synchronize the local repository with the remote one:

```execute
git pull
```

Running the *git pull* command will result in the following output if no other user has made changes to the repository:

    > Current branch master is up to date.

**Rename a file** 

To rename a file, you can use the *mv* command.

**Usage**: *`mv <old_filename> <new_filename>`*

Then follow the usual steps to push it to the remote repository:

```execute
mv Steve_Karl_25062019.txt Karl_Steve_25062019.txt
```

```execute
git status -s
```

Running the command above will result in output similar to the following:

    > D Steve_Karl_25062019.txt
    > ?? Karl_Steve_25062019.txt

**Revert changes to a file**

Sometimes we may accidentally modify or delete a file from our working directory. In this case, we can revert this modification using the *git checkout* command.

**Usage**: *`git checkout <filename>`*

```execute
git checkout .
```

Run the following command to list files (it's letter 'l' in command and not number):

```execute
ls -l 
```

Running the command above will result in output similar to the following:

    > -rw-rw-r--. 1 student student   19 Jun 26 01:19 Karl_Steve_25062019.txt
    > -rwxrwxr-x. 1 student student 7059 Jun 25 05:54 mvnw
    > -rwxrwxr-x. 1 student student 5007 Jun 25 05:54 mvnw.cmd
    > -rw-rw-r--. 1 student student 1601 Jun 25 05:54 pom.xml
    > drwxrwxr-x. 3 student student 4096 Jun 25 05:54 src
    > -rw-rw-r--. 1 student student   19 Jun 26 01:25 Steve_Karl_25062019.txt


**Delete a file**

To delete a file, you can use the *git rm* command.

**Usage**: *`git rm <filename>`*

Example:

```execute
git rm Steve_Karl_25062019.txt
```

Running the command above will result in the following output:

    > rm 'initial/Steve_Karl_25062019.txt'

You can now commit your changes using the following command:

```execute
git commit -m 'Deleting a file'
```

Output of the command above will be similar to the following: 

    > \[master 672b6c1] Deleting a file
    >  1 file changed, 1 deletion(-)
    >  delete mode 100644 initial/Steve_Karl_25062019.txt

You can now push your changes to the remote repository using the following command:

```execute
git push origin master
```

Enter your username and password when prompted by the terminal. After authentication, you should see output similar to the following:

    > Counting objects: 5, done.
    > Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
    > Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
    > Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 297 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.
    > Total 3 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
    > remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (2/2), completed with 2 local objects.
    > To https​://github​.com/openshift-user/gs-maven.git
    >    f5ce525..672b6c1  master -> master

**Branches**

We often need to create a parallel line of development (called a "branch") to work on a new feature. By default, Git has a "master branch", which is the same as the "trunk" in Subversion. 

Once the new feature is completed, we need to be able to merge its branch back into the master branch, at which point the branch can be deleted. Every branch is referenced by HEAD, which points to the latest commit in the branch. 

Whenever a user makes a commit, HEAD is updated with the latest commit.

**Create a branch**

Execute the following command to create a new branch:

**Usage**: *`git branch <new_branch_name>`*

Example: 

```execute
git branch new_branch
```

**List branches**

Run the following command to list all the available branches:

```execute
git branch
```

Running the command above will result in output similar to the following:

    >  *master
    > new_branch

 An asterisk (`*`) next to the branch name specifies the branch currently in use. 

**Switch branches**

To switch between branches, you can use the *git checkout* command:

```execute
git checkout new_branch
```

Running the command above will result in the following output:

    > Switched to branch 'new_branch'

You can use the following command as a shortcut to create and switch the branch.

Example: 

```execute
git checkout -b second_branch
```

Use the following command to list the branches:

```execute
git branch
```

Running the command above will result in output similar to the following: 

    > master
    >
    > new_branch
    >
    > * second_branch

**Delete branch**

To delete a particular branch, you first need to switch to the master branch, then use the *-D* option to delete the branch. Please see the example below:

```execute
git checkout master
```

```execute
git branch -D second_branch
```

Deleting the branch will result in output similar to the following:(You may see different code in brackets for branch)

    > Deleted branch second_branch (was f5ce525).

Now when you list the branches, you will see all the branches except for the deleted one.

**Tags**

Tags are very similar to branches, but the difference is that tags are immutable. Tags are linked to a specific version of the repository. Once a tag is created for a particular commit, even if a user creates a new commit, the tag will not be updated. Developers can maintain different tags for various product releases.

**Create tags**

We can tag the current HEAD by using the *git tag* command.

**Usage**: *`git tag -a <tagName> -m <tagMessage>`*

 This command must be run from the project directory.

**Example:** 

```execute
git tag -a 'Release_1_0' -m 'Tagged basic string operation code' HEAD
```

If you want to tag a particular commit, use the appropriate COMMIT ID instead of the HEAD pointer.

You can use the following command to push this tag to the remote repository:

```execute
git push origin tag Release_1_0
```

You will be prompted for your Git username and password. Upon successful authentication, you will see output similar to the following:

    > Counting objects: 1, done.
    > Writing objects: 100% (1/1), 187 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.
    > Total 1 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
    > To https​://github​.com/openshift-user/gs-maven.git
    >
    >  * \[new tag]         Release_1_0 -> Release_1_0

**View tags**

To view the tags available, we can use the *git tag -l* command:

```execute
git tag -l
```

Running the command above will result in output similar to the following:

    > 1.4.1.RELEASE
    > 1.4.2.RELEASE
    > 1.4.3.RELEASE
    > 2.0.2.RELEASE
    > 2.0.3.RELEASE
    > 2.0.5.RELEASE
    > Release_1_0

**Delete tags**

To delete a tag from the local repository, we can run the *git tag* command with the *-d* option.

**Usage**: *`git tag -d <tagName>`*

Example: 

```execute
git tag -d '1.4.1.RELEASE'
```

Running the command above will result in output similar to the following:

    > Deleted tag '1.4.1.RELEASE' (was eafbd03)
